#  Japanese Billionaire Acquires Dazzling Reef Encounter Casino

Japanese billionaire Katsuya Takahashi has agreed to purchase the Dazzling Reef Encounter casino in a deal worth $850 million. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, will give Takahashi majority ownership of the property.

The casino is currently the eighth-largest in Macau, with gross gaming revenue of $1.5 billion last year. Takahashi's investment is seen as a bet on the continued growth of the casino market in Macau, which overtook Las Vegas as the world's largest gambling center several years ago.

"We are excited to have Mr. Takahashi join our team and believe his resources and insight will be instrumental in taking our company to the next level," said Dazzling Reef Encounter CEO Kenichi Motohashi in a statement. "We look forward to working together to capitalize on the tremendous potential of this property."

The move comes as Takahashi continues to expand his holdings in the gambling industry. In addition to the Dazzling Reef Encounter, he also owns stakes in casinos in Australia, Singapore, and South Korea.

Another Southern Region casino falls into new ownership as the regional gaming market continues to consolidate. 

The latest casino to change hands is the Harrah's Cherokee casino, which was acquired by the Penn National Gaming company. The $1.8 billion deal also included two other casinos in the region, the Hollywood Casino Columbus and the Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course.

Penn National Gaming is one of the largest gaming companies in the country, with more than 40 properties in 20 states. The acquisition of Harrah's Cherokee will make it the largest casino operator in North Carolina.

This latest move comes as the Southern Region gaming market becomes increasingly concentrated, with three companies now controlling more than 60% of the market. Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International, and Penn National Gaming are all jockeying for position in a market that is expected to see continued growth in coming years.

#  Trans-Pacific Partnership fallout? Japanese company buys major Australian casino

Reports coming out of Australia today are indicating that a large Japanese company, believed to be Mitsubishi, has made a major purchase of an Australian casino. This is seen as a move to get around the stalled Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, which would have opened up the Australian market to more foreign competition.

The TPP has been in negotiation for many years now, with the aim of breaking down trade barriers between a number of Pacific Rim countries. One sticking point has been the reluctance of some countries, like Japan, to open their markets up to more foreign competition. It's thought that this move by Mitsubishi is designed to circumvent these restrictions and allow them greater access to the Australian market.

Mitsubishi has not yet confirmed or denied these reports, but if they are true it could have major implications for the TPP negotiations. It's possible that this move could cause other countries involved in the negotiations to rethink their position and could lead to the eventual collapse of the TPP.

This could be bad news for Australia, as the TPP is seen as being critical to the country's future economic development. The agreement would open up new opportunities for Australian businesses and help boost growth in the country's economy. Without the TPP, Australia could find itself at a disadvantage compared to other countries in the region.
