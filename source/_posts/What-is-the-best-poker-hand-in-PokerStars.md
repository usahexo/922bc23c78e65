#  What is the best poker hand in PokerStars?

There are many ways to answer this question, as there are a variety of poker games with different winning hands. However, if we take a look at the most commonly played game - Texas Hold'em - there is a clear answer.

The best poker hand in Texas Hold'em is Aces full of Kings. This combination is called a "royal flush" and it is the best possible hand you can get in the game.

There are other winning hands in Texas Hold'em, such as four of a kind, a straight flush or a full house. However, none of these are as good as the royal flush and so if you are playing Texas Hold'em, your aim should be to try and win with this combination.

#  What are the odds of getting a royal flush in PokerStars?

A royal flush is the highest possible hand in poker and is made up of an ace, king, queen, jack, and ten of the same suit. The odds of being dealt this hand are approximately 1 in 649,740.

There are a number of ways to improve your chances of being dealt a royal flush. Firstly, always play with the maximum number of hands possible. Secondly, try to play at tables where there is a low number of players. And finally, remember that the odds are better if you are playing higher-denomination chips.

#  What is the best starting hand in Texas Hold'em?

There is no one definitive answer to this question. What makes a great starting hand in Texas Hold'em can vary depending on the situation and the players involved. However, there are a few hands that are generally considered to be strong starting hands.

The best starting hand in Texas Hold'em is usually considered to be Aces, especially if there are suited cards as well. This hand has good potential for both high and low straights, as well as potentially making a flush. Another strong starting hand is Kings, which can also make a flush or a straight flush.

Other hands that can be considered strong starting hands include Queens, Jacks, Tens and Nines. These hands have potential to make strong hands such as straights or flushes, but they are not as strong as Aces or Kings. However, they still have a lot of potential to win the pot if played correctly.

Of course, it is important to remember that what constitutes a strong starting hand can vary depending on the situation. For example, if there are several low- ranked cards on the table, then a hand like 2-3-4 may be stronger than some of the higher-ranked hands mentioned above. Conversely, if there are several high-ranking cards on the table, then a hand like 6-7-8 may be weaker than some of the other hands.

In general though, these are some of the strongest starting hands in Texas Hold'em poker.

For example, if you are playing Texas Hold’em with 9 players at the table, the probability of being dealt four of a kind is about 1 in 121,000.
