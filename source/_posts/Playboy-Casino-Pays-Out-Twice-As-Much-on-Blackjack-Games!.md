Las Vegas, NV - In an effort to attract more high-rolling blackjack players, Caesars Palace Casino is offering exclusive double payouts on games played with Borges.

Borges is a card counting system that was developed by mathematician Edward Thorp in the early 1960s. The system allows players to keep track of the ratio of high cards to low cards in the deck, which gives them an advantage over the house.

"Players who are familiar with the Borges counting system can really capitalize on these exclusive double payouts," said casino spokesperson Jameson Fitzpatrick.

The casino is also offering a 10% rebate on losses incurred while playing blackjack games with Borges. The rebate is calculated on a daily basis and can be redeemed at any time.

"We wanted to create an incentive for players to try out our new blackjack games with Borges," said Fitzpatrick. "These offers are sure to appeal to serious gamblers."
