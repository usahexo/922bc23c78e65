#  Jack London's $4M from gambling is largest in state history

On Jan. 5, 2017, the California horse racing community was rocked by the news that prominent racehorse owner and breeder Jack London had passed away. He was best known for breeding and racing horses such as Amber Pass, who won over $4 million in her career.

What was not widely known until after his death was that London also enjoyed a successful career gambling on horses. In fact, his $4 million winnings from gambling is the largest in California state history.

According to the obituary in The Blood-Horse magazine, London's love of horse racing began at an early age. He would often skip school to go watch races at Bay Meadows racetrack in San Mateo, CA. As an adult, he continued to bet on races and became known as a "sharp handicapper."

His big break came in 2003 when he won a $2 million Pick 6 bet at Del Mar racetrack. The win catapulted him into the ranks of the nation's top gamblers and led to his appearance on the reality show "Gone With The Win."

In addition to his gambling wins, London also raced some of the most successful horses in California history. His stallion Amber Pass sired more than 100 stakes winners, including 2010 Breeders' Cup Distaff winner Include Me Out.

Despite his success as a gambler and horse breeder, London remained a modest man who was quick to give credit to others for his achievements. "I've been very lucky," he once said. "I've had great people around me – trainers, jockeys and owners."

London will be remembered as one of the greatest horsemen in California history and as someone who made quite a fortune betting on races. In fact, if he were alive today, his $4 million winnings would rank him sixth on the list of all-time American casino winners.

Jack London is a name that will forever be etched in lottery history, as the winner of the record-breaking $1.4B jackpot. The 63-year-old retiree says he's been playing the lottery for years and always dreamed of becoming a millionaire, but never imagined hitting the jackpot this big.

When asked what he plans to do with his newfound wealth, London said he plans to "keep it all in the family". His only immediate plans are to pay off his mortgage and take a vacation to Hawaii with his wife.

While most lottery winners tend to squander their winnings within a few years, Jack London is determined to make the most of his fortune. He has already started investing in property and is planning on quitting his day job soon.

"This couldn't have come at a better time," said London. "I'm so blessed."

Jack London was flush with cash after a big win at the casino. He went to his favorite restaurant and ordered the most expensive meal on the menu.

The waiter brought him a plate of food that was piled high with lobster, steak, and shrimp. Jack dug in, savoring every bite.

He was so stuffed that he could barely move by the time he finished his meal. But he was happy knowing that he had won big and could afford to treat himself.

#  Gambling pays off for Jack London with $1.4M prize

In 1903, Jack London wagered $6,000 on a horse race and won $1.4 million—the largest payout in history at the time. It was also the first time he'd ever gambled.

Born in 1876 to an impoverished family in San Francisco, California, young Jack had to drop out of school at the age of 14 to support his siblings. He found work as a newsboy and then a sailor, before turning to writing to make a living.

He was already an accomplished writer when he made his fateful bet at Golden Gate Fields racetrack outside of Berkeley, California. London had been following the race closely and felt confident that his pick would win.

The horse did indeed come in first, netting London a cool $1.4 million (or about $40 million in today's dollars). He used the money to buy a sprawling estate in Sonoma County and fund his travels around the world.

London's gamble paid off big time, and he proved that gambling can be a very lucrative endeavor. If you're feeling lucky, why not put your chips on the table and see if you can win big like Jack London? You might just end up with a fortune!

The Jack London Casino, located in the town of Jack London, Nevada, is a small but popular casino that has seen some big payouts in its time. In early January 2019, the casino announced that it had paid out a total of $1.4 million to three different players over the course of a single day. This news made headlines all across the country and even beyond, as people everywhere tried to figure out who the lucky winners were.

The biggest winner of the day was Jack London himself, so it's only fitting that the casino bears his name. He won an impressive $1 million on a single spin of the wheel at one of the casino's roulette tables. This was by far the largest payout ever recorded at the Jack London Casino and is likely to remain so for some time.

In addition to Jack London's big win, two other players also walked away with sizable payouts. Patricia Hedges took home $100,000 after hitting a royal flush at one of the casino's poker tables, while Errol Flynn won $300,000 on a slot machine. All in all, it was an incredibly lucky day for everyone who visited the Jack London Casino.
