#  Golden State Warriors Officially Crowned NBA Champions

The Golden State Warriors won the 2018 NBA Championship on Friday night, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-0 in the Finals. This is the Warriors’ third championship in four years and their fourth in five seasons.

Stephen Curry led the way for Golden State, averaging 27.3 points per game while shooting 43.6 percent from three-point range. Kevin Durant was also impressive, averaging 26.4 points, 10 rebounds, and 7.1 assists per game.

LeBron James was once again the best player for Cleveland, averaging 34.2 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 9.0 assists per game. However, it wasn’t enough to overcome the firepower of the Warriors.

Golden State will now enter into another offseason with high expectations, as they look to win a fourth championship in five seasons and cement themselves as one of the all-time great teams in NBA history.

#  Golden State Warriors Go 33-0 in Regular Season

The Golden State Warriors completed their best season in NBA history on Wednesday night, finishing with a record of 73-9. This amazing feat was accomplished by going 33-0 in the regular season against teams that did not make the playoffs.

The Warriors faced several challenges during the year, including adapting to new head coach Steve Kerr and overcoming injuries to several key players. But they were able to persevere and finish the season with an unblemished record.

This team is incredibly talented, with Stephen Curry leading the way. Curry averaged 30 points per game this season and was named MVP for the second year in a row. Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala all had solid seasons as well, making the Warriors difficult to beat.

The postseason begins on Saturday, and the Warriors are favored to win their second championship in three years. They will face either the Oklahoma City Thunder or the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals, with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line.

#  Golden State Warriors obliterate Cleveland Cavaliers to take home NBA Championship

For the third time in four years, the Golden State Warriors are NBA Champions. This year’s Finals was a mismatch from start to finish, as the Warriors completed a sweep of the Cavaliers with a dominating win in Game 4.

It was clear from the beginning that Cleveland didn’t have a chance. The Warriors led by as many as 16 points in the first half, and never looked back. Stephen Curry led the way for Golden State with 37 points, while Kevin Durant added 26 points and 10 rebounds.

LeBron James had another valiant effort for Cleveland, scoring 33 points and 13 rebounds, but it wasn’t enough. No other Cavalier scored more than 14 points, and Cleveland shot just 35 percent from the field overall.

The Warriors were simply too much for Cleveland to handle. They dominated on both ends of the floor, using their elite shooting and passing to create open looks for themselves and frustrate the Cavaliers defenders. This was easily their most impressive performance of the postseason, and they now have their third championship in four years.

#  Golden State Warriors quickest NBA team to win championship

The Golden State Warriors became the quickest team to win an NBA championship, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1 in the Finals. The Warriors are now 3-0 in the Finals against Cleveland. The Warriors were led by Steph Curry who averaged 27.8 points, 6 rebounds and 7 assists for the series. Klay Thompson also had a great series averaging 22 points per game. Kevin Durant, who was acquired in free agency last year, also played great averaging 28 points and 10 rebounds per game.

This was a dominant performance by the Warriors and they looked like they were the best team in the NBA all season long. They have now won two championships in three years and it looks like they are going to be one of the dominant teams in the NBA for years to come.

#  Golden State Warriors Dominate the Playoffs

In the 2016-2017 NBA Playoffs, the Golden State Warriors have dominated their opponents. They are now in the Western Conference Finals, where they will be playing the San Antonio Spurs.

Led by superstar Stephen Curry and head coach Steve Kerr, the Warriors have outscored their opponents by an average of 16.3 points per game in the playoffs. They are also shooting extremely well from three-point range, making an average of 14.5 threes per game.

The Warriors are poised to make another trip to the NBA Finals, where they will likely face off against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavaliers have struggled against the Warriors in recent years, losing six out of seven games against them.

If the Warriors can continue to play at a high level, they should be able to easily defeat the Spurs and advance to the NBA Finals.
