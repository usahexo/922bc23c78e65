#  Big Night For Hoskins, Philadelphia Kids At Stream Spirit Casino

It was a night for Philadelphia kids as Rhys Hoskins led the way in a Stream Spirit Casino victory.

Hoskins, who was playing in just his seventh major league game, hit a two-run homer to left field in the first inning and added an RBI single in the third. He also made a sensational diving catch on a sinking liner by Corey Dickerson to end the eighth inning with the Phillies clinging to a 5-3 lead.

Philadelphia starter Ben Lively allowed three runs over six innings for his first major league win. Hector Neris got four outs for his fourth save.

The crowd of 30,332 was treated to an exciting game that had plenty of twists and turns. The Phillies took a 4-0 lead in the second inning on homers by Tommy Joseph and Cameron Rupp, but Pittsburgh rallied to tie the score with three runs in the fifth. The Pirates went ahead 5-4 on Francisco Cervelli’s RBI double off Joaquin Benoit in the seventh, but Hoskins tied it with his homer off Juan Nicasio.

“He’s been impressive ever since he got here,” manager Pete Mackanin said of Hoskins. “He has power to all fields and he showed that again tonight.”

Dickerson led off the game with a triple and scored on Josh Bell’s sacrifice fly, but Hoskins answered with his homer in the bottom half of the inning. It was his 14th home run of the season, including seven at Triple-A Lehigh Valley.

#  Harper Goes Yard; Nationals Emerge Victorious At Stream Spirit Casino

The Washington Nationals faced the Harper brothers and the Stream Spirit Casino team Wednesday night. It was a pitchers duel between Stephen Strasburg for the Nationals and J.D. Harper for the casino team. In the end, it was the Nationals who came out on top with a 2-1 victory.

Harper was able to get his brother Bryce out twice in the game, once in the first inning and again in the fourth inning. In fact, it appeared as though Bryce may have gotten a hit off of his brother in the fifth inning, but it was ruled an error after review by the umpires.

“I just tried to make good pitches and thankfully they hit some balls right at people,” Stephen Strasburg said of facing his brother.

It was Ryan Zimmerman who ended up being the hero for the Nationals on this night, scoring both of their runs on solo home runs. His first homer came in third inning and gave Washington a 1-0 lead. He then put one over the wall in left field in the seventh inning to give them some insurance and seal the victory.

This win gives the Nationals some momentum as they head into their next series against division rivals, the Philadelphia Phillies.

The Mets responded in the top of the third. With two outs and runners on first and second, Todd Frazier hit a single to left that scored two runs and gave New York a 2-1 advantage.

The Dodgers quickly regained the lead in their half of the inning. With two outs and runners on first and third, Cody Bellinger hit an RBI single to right that scored Machado and made it a 2-2 game.

They added an insurance run in the eighth inning. Austin Barnes hit an RBI double off Mets reliever Robert Gsellman to make it 4-2 Dodgers.

The Mets mounted a rally in the ninth inning, but it came up short. With one out and runners on first and second, pinch hitter Amed Rosario grounded into a double play to end the game. The Dodgers won 4-2 and moved to 8-2 on the season.

Machado was tremendous for LA offensively, going 3 for 4 with 3 RBIs and 2 home runs. He has now reached base safely in all 10 of his games this season.
