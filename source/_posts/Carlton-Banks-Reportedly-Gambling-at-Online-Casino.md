#  Carlton Banks Reportedly Gambling at Online Casino

Miller Mob Scene has learned exclusively that Carlton Banks of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was recently spotted gambling at an online casino.

We can report that Carlton was playing blackjack and appeared to be having a good time. The actor was seen placing bets and cheering when he won.

This isn't the first time that Carlton has been linked to gambling. In Season 4 of the show, it is revealed that he has a gambling addiction.

However, this is the first time that we have seen him gamble in an online casino. It's not clear whether or not he is still addicted to gambling, but it's certainly not a good look for him.

We reached out to Carlton for comment but did not receive a response.

#  Carlton Banks Seen Gambling at Online Casino

An individual who is allegedly Carlton Banks from the popular 1990s TV sitcom "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" has been sighted gambling at an online casino, according to reports.

The unconfirmed footage, said to have been captured at a casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, shows a man who appears to be Banks betting on blackjack and roulette games.

This is not the first time that Banks has been linked to gambling; back in 2013 it was reported that he had lost $1 million in a high stakes poker game.

In response to the latest allegations, a spokesperson for Banks issued the following statement: "There is no truth to these rumors. Mr. Banks is not and has never been a gambler."

Rogers Television announced in a press conference Wednesday that their station has been permanently removed from the Carlton Banks family approved channel lineup.

Banks, known for his role as a dapper and high-energy businessman on the hit sitcom "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" was revealed to have gambling habits which led to him being blacklisted by the major television networks.

In an email correspondence with Carlton Banks, he admitted to regularly gambling at an online casino and losing thousands of dollars in a very short period of time.

When asked why he decided to gamble even though he could clearly afford to lose, Banks said "It's just so much fun. I can easily lose $1,000 in an hour without batting an eye, but when I'm winning it's like I'm on top of the world."

Despite his reckless behavior, Banks doesn't seem too fazed by the entire ordeal. "I may not be able to watch 'The Fresh Prince' anymore, but I'm still wealthy and I can always find something else to do with my time," he said.

Gambling is a major problem in today's society and it seems that even celebrities are not immune to its allure. Carlton Banks may have thought he was just having harmless fun, but in reality he was jeopardizing his career and relationships with some of the biggest networks in the world.

#  Carlton Banks Continues to Gamble at Online Casino

The popular character from the 1990s TV sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Carlton Banks, has been sighted gambling at an online casino again. This follows on from a previous incident in which he was caught gambling at an online casino and lost a large sum of money.

At the time, Banks claimed that he had been scammed by the online casino and that they had refused to pay out his winnings. However, it appears that he may have just been bad at gambling, as he has now been caught gambling again.

This time, Carlton Banks seems to have lost even more money than he did last time. He is reported to have lost over $50,000 in a single night of gambling. It is not clear whether or not Banks will be able to recover this money, but it is likely that he will face more financial difficulties as a result of his continued gambling addiction.

It is sad to see such a well-loved character like Carlton Banks struggling with addiction issues. However, hopefully this latest debacle will be enough to convince him to seek help for his problem and get his life back on track.

#  Carlton Banks' Gambling Addiction Leads Him to Online Casino

Carlton Banks, a character from the popular 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, is known for his high energy and eccentric personality. What many people don't know about Carlton, however, is that he is a pathological gambler.

For years, Carlton has struggled with a gambling addiction that has caused him to lose large sums of money at casinos and other gambling establishments. In a last ditch effort to win back some of his lost funds, Carlton has turned to online casinos, where he can gamble anonymously and without the fear of being caught.

Unfortunately, Carlton's gambling addiction has only gotten worse since he started playing at online casinos. He often stays up all night playing blackjack, roulette, and other casino games, and as a result he frequently falls asleep in class and misses important appointments.

At this point, Carlton's family and friends are very concerned about his well-being. They have tried to talk to him about his addiction, but Carlton refuses to listen. He is convinced that he can beat the odds and win back all the money he has lost over the years.

Sadly, it is likely that Carlton will never overcome his gambling addiction. As long as he continues to gamble recklessly, he will only continue to spiral further downward both financially and emotionally.
