#  How to Save the Casino Sprite Twice the Diamonds Game 

The Diamonds game is a casino game that is popular with players. The objective of the game is to fill the grid with diamonds of different colors. The game can be saved in two ways.

One way to save the game is to use the diamonds that are already on the grid. If two or more diamonds of the same color are adjacent, they will disappear and the player will earn points. When all of the spaces in the grid are filled with diamonds, including those on the bottom row, then the player will earn a bonus and advance to the next level.

The other way to save the game is to use a diamond that is not on the grid. If three or more diamonds of different colors are adjacent, they will disappear and the player will earn points. When all of the spaces in the grid are filled with diamonds, including those on the bottom row, then the player will earn a bonus and advance to the next level.

Points are also earned for every diamond that is not part of a set. For example, if there is one red diamond, two blue diamonds, and four green diamonds in a row, then removing any blue diamond would result in two points being earned.
