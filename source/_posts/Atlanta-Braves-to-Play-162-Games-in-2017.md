#  Atlanta Braves to Play 162 Games in 2017

The Atlanta Braves will play 162 games during the 2017 season. This includes 81 home games at SunTrust Park and 81 away games. The Braves’ regular season begins on April 3rd against the New York Mets and ends on September 30th against the Miami Marlins.

They will host the Washington Nationals, Philadelphia Phillies, and New York Yankees in May, the Los Angeles Dodgers in June, and the Boston Red Sox in July. In addition, they will travel to face the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, and Detroit Tigers in interleague play.

SunTrust Park is a beautiful new stadium that offers great amenities for fans. There are plenty of food options inside the park, as well as interactive games for children and a state-of-the-art video board. Fans can also enjoy watching the game from one of two outdoor patios or from inside the climate-controlled HitTrax lounge.

SunTrust Park is sure to be a popular destination for Atlanta Braves fans this season. Make sure to buy your tickets soon so you don’t miss out on any of the action!

#  Braves Use All of Their Decks to Defeat Mets, Win First Series of Season

The Atlanta Braves entered their series against the Mets with high hopes. Atlanta had lost their first two games of the season, but they were coming into this matchup feeling good. They had just completed a series against the defending World Champion Miami Marlins and won two out of three games.

The Braves started the scoring in the top of the third inning. With runners on first and second base, Freddie Freeman hit an RBI single to give Atlanta a 1-0 lead. The Braves added to their lead in the fourth inning. This time it was Nick Markakis who drove in a run with a single to make it 2-0 Atlanta.

In the bottom of the fourth inning, Mets starter Jacob deGrom finally got into trouble. He gave up back-to-back doubles to Ender Inciarte and Freeman which made it 3-0 Braves. deGrom was then pulled from the game after just four innings pitched.

The Mets would get on the scoreboard in the bottom of the sixth inning. Yoenis Cespedes hit a solo home run off Braves reliever Shane Carle to make it 3-1 Atlanta. But that would be all the scoring that New York could muster on this day.

The Braves added to their lead in the top of the seventh inning. This time it was Inciarte who drove in a run with a triple to make it 4-1 Atlanta. Inciarte then scored on a wild pitch by Mets reliever Addison Reed to make it 5-1 Braves.

Reed was able to get out of further trouble in that inning, but he was done for the day. He would be charged with five runs (all earned) over two innings pitched and took his first loss of the season.

The Mets bullpen continued to struggle on this day. They gave up six more runs over the final three innings as Atlanta cruised to an 11-1 victory. It was their first series win of the season and moved them above .500 at 3-2. The Mets bullpen allowed 16 runs (12 earned) over 7 innings pitched in this game and are now 0-5 on the season with an ERA of 10.29

#  Freeman's Grand Slam Leads Braves over Nationals

The Atlanta Braves had plenty to celebrate on Thursday night, with a convincing 8-2 victory over the Washington Nationals. Freddie Freeman led the way offensively, hitting a grand slam in the fourth inning that helped stake the Braves to an early lead.

It was Freeman's third homer in as many games, and it was more than enough for Julio Teheran and the Braves' bullpen. Teheran allowed just two runs over six innings, and four Braves relievers combined to pitch three scoreless innings of relief.

Now with a record of 24-19, the Braves are just 2.5 games behind the Nationals in the NL East. They'll have a chance to make up more ground this weekend when they host Washington for a three-game series.

#  Cincinnati Reds Hand Atlanta Braves Their First Loss

This was a much-needed win for the Cincinnati Reds, who handed the Atlanta Braves their first loss of the season in dramatic fashion. The Reds were down 6-0 going into the bottom of the ninth inning, but they rallied to score seven runs and win the game 7-6. This was an impressive comeback victory that showed the character of this team.

One of the key players in this comeback win was Scooter Gennett, who hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning to tie the game. Gennett has been one of the best hitters in baseball so far this season, and he is a major reason why the Reds are off to a strong start.

The bullpen also played a key role in this victory, as Jared Hughes and Raisel Iglesias both pitched scoreless innings in relief. Hughes has been one of the most reliable pitchers on the Reds' staff so far this season, and Iglesias has been one of their top closers.

The Reds will look to continue their winning streak when they face the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday night. This will be another tough test for Cincinnati, but they appear to be up for the challenge.

#  Atlanta Braves Sweep San Diego Padres

The Atlanta Braves swept the San Diego Padres over the weekend, in decisive fashion. On Saturday, the Braves won 5-2 behind a strong outing from Mike Foltynewicz. The veteran right-hander went six innings, striking out seven hitters and giving up just two runs. Dansby Swanson and Freddie Freeman each hit home runs in support of Foltynewicz.

Sunday’s game was even more one-sided, as the Braves cruised to a 10-1 victory. Rookie starter Max Fried was dominant, going six innings while allowing just one run on three hits. He also collected seven strikeouts. Ronald Acuna Jr. led the way offensively for Atlanta, going 3-5 with a home run and four RBIs. The sweep extended the Braves’ winning streak to five games and improved their record to 52-40 on the season.

The Braves are now just 2 1/2 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL East standings. They will look to keep the momentum going when they welcome the Miami Marlins to SunTrust Park for a three-game series starting on Tuesday night.
