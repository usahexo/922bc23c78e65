#  How old do you need to be to gamble at a casino in Sacramento? 

The legal gambling age in Sacramento is 21. This applies to all forms of gambling, including casinos, poker rooms, and racetracks. 

There are a few exceptions. Minors are allowed to gamble on horse and dog races, and in the state’s lottery system. There is also a special exception for tribal casinos, which can allow people as young as 18 to gamble on their premises. 

The reason for the age limit in Sacramento is to protect people from getting into financial trouble. Gambling can be addictive, and it’s easy for young people to lose control of their spending when they are in a casino or online poker room. 

If you are caught gambling underage, you may face fines or even jail time. It’s not worth the risk – wait until you’re 21 and then enjoy the many gambling options that Sacramento has to offer.

#  Can minors enter casinos in Sacramento? 

Casinos in Sacramento are 18+. There is no exception for minors. 

Since the passage of Proposition 1A in 2000, California casinos have been restricted to those aged 21+. The law was intended to minimize gambling addiction and other negative consequences among young people. This restriction also applies to minors – anyone under 21 is not allowed in a casino, regardless of their level of involvement in gambling. 

There are some exceptions for underage gamblers. Those who are 18-20 may enter a casino if they are accompanied by someone over 21 (a parent, legal guardian, etc.). In addition, those under 18 are allowed in Indian casinos as long as they are accompanied by an adult. 

The rationale behind the age limit is that young people are more likely to develop addictive behaviors and make bad financial decisions when it comes to gambling. Casinos don’t want these problems associated with their businesses, so they enforce a strict age requirement. 

But what about those who are already addicted? Is there any help available for them? 

Yes, there is help available for both minors and adults who have gambling addiction issues. Gamblers Anonymous is a 12-step program that can provide support for those trying to overcome an addiction to gambling. There are also treatment centers specifically for addicts, as well as counseling services available through many health insurance plans. If you or someone you know has a problem with gambling, it’s important to seek out help as soon as possible.
