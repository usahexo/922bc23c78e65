#  What Is The Minimum Age For New Jersey Gems and Riches Gambling?

#  Age Requirements For New Jersey Gems and Riches Gambling Explained

The legal gambling age in the state of New Jersey is 21. That’s because at that age, citizens are legally allowed to drink alcohol and enter into contracts. The age for both of those activities was deemed appropriate for gambling as well, back when New Jersey first legalized casino gambling in 1978.

Some people speculate that the age requirement might be lowered in the future, but there’s no evidence that this will happen in the near future. In the meantime, anyone who is not yet 21 will have to wait a few years before they can partake in NJ gambling activities.

There are some exceptions to the rule, however. For instance, 18-year-olds can gamble at casinos if they are accompanied by someone over the age of 21. And PASPA – the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act – allows states to offer sports betting if it has been specifically legalized by state law. So far, only New Jersey and three other states have taken advantage of this allowance.

Age requirements can seem like a frustrating barrier for some people, but they are an important part of protecting consumers. By setting a legal age limit, governments can ensure that those who gamble are old enough to make informed decisions and understand the risks involved. This protects both players and casinos alike, and it’s likely that the age requirement will remain at 21 for New Jersey Gems and Riches Gambling in the foreseeable future.
