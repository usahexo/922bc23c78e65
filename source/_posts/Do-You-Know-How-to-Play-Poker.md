## The Rules of Poker

Poker is a card game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to collect as many chips as possible by winning hands against your opponents.

The basic rules of poker are as follows:

- Each player is dealt five cards face down.

- The player with the highest ranking hand wins the pot.

- In the event of a tie, the pot is split evenly between the players involved in the tie.

- There are four different suits in poker - hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds. In order, the rank of each suit is ace, king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Aces are high and queens are low.

That's basically all you need to know in order to start playing poker! Of course, there are a few other things that we need to cover before we move on. Let's take a look at some of the most important terms in poker:

- Blinds: These are two forced bets that are made before any cards are shown. The player to the left of the dealer posts a small blind and the player to their left posts a big blind. These bets help to create action in the game and they also serve as a way to limited losses for short-handed games.

- Pot: This is the total amount of money that has been gathered from all players during a particular hand. The player who wins the hand collects this money and becomes the new chip leader.


- Flop: This is when three community cards are placed face up on the table after all players have folded or completed their hands. These cards help players form their final hand.

- Turn: This is when another community card is placed face up on the table after the flop has been dealt.

#  How to Play Poker - the Basics

If you've never played poker before, don't worry - it's a simple game once you understand the basics. This guide will teach you the basics of playing poker, from the different types of games to the different hands you can make.

## Poker Games
The most common type of poker game is Texas Hold'em. In this game, each player is dealt two cards (called "hole cards"), and then five community cards are dealt face-up in the middle of the table. Players then take turns betting, folding, or calling, until all but one player has folded. At that point, the remaining player reveals their hole cards and the player with the best hand wins.

There are many other types of poker games, including Omaha, Stud, and Razz. Each game has its own unique set of rules, so be sure to learn them before playing.

## Poker Hands
In Texas Hold'em, there are 13 possible hands that you can make:

1) royal flush - an Ace through 10 of the same suit;
2) straight flush - five consecutive cards of the same suit;
3) four of a kind - four cards of the same rank;
4) full house - three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank;
5) flush - five cards of the same suit;
6) straight - five consecutive cards not all of the same suit;
7) three of a kind - three cards of the same rank;
8) two pair - two different pairs of cards; 
9) one pair - two matching cards; 10) high card - any card that doesn't fit into any other category.

#  The Best Way to Play Poker

There are a lot of different ways that people like to play poker. Some people prefer to keep the cards close to their chest, while others like to gamble and go all in. No matter which way you like to play, there is a method that will work best for you.

If you want to be successful playing poker, you need to find a style that suits you and stick with it. You also need to make sure that you are comfortable with the game before you start risking any money.

Once you have found a style that works for you, the next step is to practice as much as possible. The more time you spend playing poker, the better your chances of winning will be. You can also learn a lot by watching other players and studying their strategies.

If you are new to poker, it’s important to start off slow and be patient. Don’t try to win every hand, because that is not always possible. Try to focus on making good decisions and playing smart instead of playing aggressively.

The most important thing when playing poker is to have fun. If you are not enjoying yourself, then it’s probably not the right game for you. Poker can be a lot of fun, but it can also be frustrating at times. Just remember to stay calm and never make decisions when you are angry or upset.

#  How Poker Hands are Selected

There are 52 cards in a deck, and ten Poker hands. So how do the hands get picked?

To start, the dealer pulls out one card from the deck and sets it in the middle of the table - this is called the burn card. Then, the dealer takes three cards from the deck and sets them aside face down - these are called the flop. The next card after the flop is turned over, and this is called the turn. The final card after the turn is turned over, and this is called the river.

The player to the dealer's left starts by betting one unit, and then players can either call (match) the bet, fold (leave), or raise (bet more money). When all players have either folded or put in an equal amount of money, then it goes to showdown. At showdown, each player shows their best five-card Poker hand, using any combination of their own two cards andthe three communal cards on the table. The player withthe best hand wins!

Here are some sample hands:

One pair: Two cards of the same rank

Two pair: Two different pairs of cards

Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank

Straight: Five consecutive ranked cards (not all suits)

Flush: All five cards are from one suit (e.g. all hearts)

Full house: Three matching cards plus two matching cards (e.g. 3 kings + 2 sixes)

Four of a kind: Four identical cards rankwise (e.g. four aces) 
Quadra: Four identicalcardsrankwise AND suitwise(e g 4 spades)

Royal flush: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten all from one suit

#  Texas Hold'em Poker for Beginners

This guide is designed to teach beginners the basic rules of Texas Hold'em Poker.

Poker is a classic card game that has been enjoyed by people for centuries. The objective of the game is to collect the best hand possible using the five cards dealt to each player. In Texas Hold'em, players are only allowed to use two of their five cards to form their final hand. The other three cards are called the 'community cards' and are placed in the middle of the table for all players to see.

The game begins with each player being dealt two cards face down. These are known as your 'hole cards'. The player with the highest-value hole card starts the betting round by placing a bet, known as a 'ante'. All other players must then either match this bet or fold, losing any chips they may have wagered thus far.

After the first bet has been made, three community cards are placed face up on the table. This is known as 'the flop'. Another betting round now takes place, starting with the player who opened the betting round before the flop (known as the 'pre-flop raiser'). Players can now use any four of their seven cards to make their best possible hand (two from their hole cards and two from the community cards).

The fourth community card is then revealed, followed by another betting round. This time, however, only players who still remain in the hand can bet - everyone else has already folded. The fifth and final community card is then revealed, followed by one last betting round. The player with the best five-card poker hand wins the pot. Let's take a look at an example:

Player 1: Ace of Spades, 2 of Hearts

Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 4 of Diamonds



The flop: Queen of Clubs, King of Spades, 10 of Spades
 

Pre-flop raiser: Player 1 (Ace of Spades, 2 of Hearts) - opens for $0.50 

1st post-flop bet: Player 2 ($1) 

2nd post-flop bet: Player 3 ($3) 

3rd post-flop bet: Player 4 ($6)
