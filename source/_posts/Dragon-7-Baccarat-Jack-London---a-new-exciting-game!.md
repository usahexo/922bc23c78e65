#  How to play Dragon 7 Baccarat Jack London 

Dragon 7 Baccarat is a variant of the classic baccarat game that has been around for centuries. The game is played with six decks of cards and is popular in Asia, especially in Macau.

The aim of the game is to bet on which hand (player or banker) will have a total score closest to nine. If both player and banker have the same total, the banker wins. A player can either bet on their own hand or on the banker’s hand, and can also bet on a tie.

To begin the game, each player is given two cards face up and the dealer is given one card face up and one card face down. The value of each card is added together to get the total score for that hand. The Ace is worth one point, while all other cards are worth their face value.

If either the player or banker has an eight or nine, they immediately win and no further cards are drawn. If either player has a total score of less than five, they must draw another card. If the player has a total of six or seven, they can choose to either draw another card or stand. If the banker has a total score of six or seven, they must draw another card.


Once both the player and banker have had all their cards, any totals over nine are reduced to nine (e.g., 18 becomes 9). The highest possible score for either hand is nine points (i.e., two cards with values of four and five). The lowest possible score is zero points (i.e., two cards with values of two and three).


The payout for each bet depends on the odds offered by the casino: 

 - Betting on the player’s hand pays out 1:1 
- Betting on the banker’s hand pays out 19:20   - Betting on a tie pays out 8:1
